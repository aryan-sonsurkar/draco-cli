## draco-cli
Draco is a command-line assistant built step by step while learning Python.

The project focuses on writing clean, modular code and gradually adding powerful automation and AI-driven features.

Instead of creating small isolated scripts, Draco is designed as a real, extensible CLI tool with practical use cases.
